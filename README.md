# giri-fu

## Intro
This is the firmware and hardware of the giri functional unit.
`giri-fu` is an AVR MCU, which includes simple start-stop timer logic for some channels to switch on and off relays.
This project is also a prototype project for AVR developments.
This can serve as template, or archetype for creating other projects.
